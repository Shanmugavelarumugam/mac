        Rohit Sharma's one statement after the Champions Trophy 2025 elated the whole nation. There was a lot of
        speculation
        about his career future, but Rohit Sharma allayed all those fears in classic 'Rohit Sharma way': <br><br>
        <strong>"I am not going to retire from this format. Just to make sure no rumours are spread moving forward. Koi
            future plan hai nahi, jo chal raha hai chalega."</strong><br><br>

        A day later, Rohit gave an even more detailed response on his career plans: <br>
        <em>"Right now, I am taking things as they come. It wouldn't be fair for me to think too far ahead. At this
            moment, my focus is on playing well and maintaining the right mindset."</em><br><br>

        If reports are to be believed, Rohit is planning to extend his career till the 2027 World Cup in South Africa,
        Zimbabwe, and Namibia. He will collaborate with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar to work on fitness and
        batting. <br><br>

        Rohit, currently 38, will be 40 by the 2027 World Cup. He still aims to play ODIs and Tests, though he's retired
        from T20Is. His Test selection may depend on IPL form and fitness.
